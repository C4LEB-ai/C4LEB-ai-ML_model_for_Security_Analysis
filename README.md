Project Context
- 
Cybersecurity is seriously threatened by malicious websites or URLs. Malicious URLs host unsolicited content (spam, phishing, drive-by downloads, etc.) and deceive users into falling for scams (including financial loss, identity theft, and malware installation), resulting in billions of dollars in losses each year. In order to build a machine learning-based model to recognize malicious urls and prevent them from infecting computer systems or spreading through the internet, I have gathered this dataset, which contains many examples of malicious urls using the following sources.
